Changelog
=========

0.29.1 (????-??-??)
-------------------

* Removed outdated `eff-diceware-passphrase` dependency. It was breaking the
  build on arm64 due to old transitive dependencies. We've instead included the
  EFF wordlist and generate diceware passwords ourselves.
* Docker image could not be built on arm64 due to a transative dependency using
  an old version of libsodium.


0.29.0 (2025-02-07)
-------------------

* OpenID Connect works! The plumbing for this has been in place for some time,
  but this release supports the `/userinfo` endpoint and enough parameters from
  the authorization endpoint to make it work the OIDC clients we've tested.
* The dev server now automatically generates a JWT private key when it's ran
  for the first time. This enables OpenID Connect to be used without further
  configuration.
* Auth.js / NextAuth.js support validated. Our implementation had a few bugs,
  and authjs also had some issues that the server now has workarounds in place
  for.
* Lots of documentatation fixes and additions. (Thank you @usrrname).
* Workaround for authjs incorrectly encoding colon in Basic Auth with
  percent-encoding.
* #590: When a OIDC client doesn't provide a nonce, the server encoded the
  nonce as 'null' in the id token. It should have simply been omitted and this
  was breaking authjs.
* Added OpenID Connect endpoints to home screen.
* Fixed validation bugs in the OAuth2 app update screen.
* Support for the OIDC /.well-known/openid-configuration endpoint.
* Added 'email', 'phone' and 'name' claims to OpenID id token.
* Support for OpenID Connect 'userinfo' endpoint.
* #596: Support for 'prompt' parameter in OIDC authorize request.
* Support for `auth_time` in OIDC id_token
* Force users to go through login process after changing their password. Before
  this change a change-password token was enough to complete login, but this
  could allow a user to circumvent other authentication factors such as TOTP.
* Added a small HAL form for easily obtaining developer access tokens.
* Added a `/me` endpoint that always redirects to the currently authenticated
  user or app.
* Add support for `prefer: transclude=item` header and `?embed=item` query
  parameter on the `/user` collection, allowing clients to get the full
  representation of each user.
* A refresh of the home endpoint, with a few more links to OIDC endpoints.


0.28.5 (2025-01-30)
-------------------

* Fix: `authorization_challenge` was emitting an incorrect error for users
  logging in with unverified email addresses.


0.28.4 (2025-01-28)
-------------------

* Logging with an unverified email is no longer a blocker for the
  authorization-challenge system. Users can now verify their email address
  during the login process. (@chelsearoman-ca)
* Adding a friendly error message to devs trying to directly POST to the /login
  endpoint.
* Refreshed getting started and CONTRIBUTING documents. (@usrrname)
* Added some guides for getting a basic OAuth2 integration up and running using
  vanilla Javascript.
* Added guide on testing SMTP.


0.28.3 (2025-01-21)
-------------------

* Login challenge now prefers TOTP challenge over Email OTP by default.
* Fix admin logout.
* Cosmetic fixes in email templalates.
* Fix bug in password reset form.
* User can now override the a12n-server application title via the `APP_NAME`
  environment variable.


0.28.2 (2025-01-09)
-------------------

* Add a new privilege for managing user identities. Before this change it was
  required to have the 'admin' privilege to do this.
* Verify response endpoint is now exposed as a form on the identity resource.
* It's now possible to mark an identity as an MFA identity when verifying using
  the 'enableMfa' property.


0.28.1 (2025-01-08)
-------------------

* Fix a timing bug when using Redis as the kv store.


0.28.0 (2025-01-08)
-------------------

* #563: Users can now enter a code sent to them by email as a
  one-time-password. This feature has been added to the authorizion_challege /
  first party auth API but is not yet exposed to the admin interface.
* Refactored and centralized abstract cache system, supporting redis/valkey and
  memory stores.
* Email identities can now be verified in the admin UI and via the API.
* Allow authorization_challenge to be preselected in 'new client'
* Add button in admin UI to enable/disable MFA for a specific email identity.
* Dropped support for Node 16, which is EOL.


0.27.6 (2024-12-16)
-------------------

* Update @curveball/browser, which fixes an issue with submitting HTML forms
  that don't use GET or POST.


0.27.5 (2024-12-11)
-------------------

* #555: Another fix for launching the a12nserver npx script. (@Zen-cronic)


0.27.4 (2024-12-06)
-------------------

* Schemas misspelled as 'schema'. Sorry for all the releases, I dont know to do
  a clean test of npx without doing a release first, so the feedback loop is
  change->release->test.


0.27.3 (2024-12-06)
-------------------

* Copy simplewebauthn browser bundle into assets directory for easier
  distribution.


0.27.2 (2024-12-06)
-------------------

* Fix missing entries in files section in package.json, preventing the "npx
  @curveball/a12n-server" tool from working.


0.27.1 (2024-12-06)
-------------------

* Fix HTTP/500 error when requesting a developer access token.


0.27.0 (2024-12-05)
-------------------

* `authorization_challenge` now supports a TOTP challenge step!
* Refactored logging system. Less ugly now with fewer enums!
* `authorization_challenge` clients can now specify `remote_addr` and
  `user_agent`, so the server can keep accurate logs of the users' browser
  that's trying to authenticate.
* Return the correct 'ttl' value for a verification-token.
* Instead of 1 generic error with a few parameters, the server now emits
  invididual error codes for each kind of error that may be emitted from the
  authorization_challenge endpoint. This is change is based on examples in more
  recent drafts and should simplify the process for clients a bit. This is a BC
  break for `authorization_challenge`.
* Renamed `login_failed` event to `password-check-failed`.
* Added events: `password-check-succes`, `totp-success`,
  `login-challenge-started`, `login-challenge-success`


0.26.7 (2024-11-07)
-------------------

* Updated Curveball dependencies. `CURVEBALL_TRUSTPROXY` should now work as
  expected.


0.26.6 (2024-11-06)
-------------------

* Updated Curveball dependencies


0.26.5 (2024-10-30)
-------------------

* Developer tokens will now be associated with a client_id if an OAuth2 client
  was used to generate one. This allows them to be refreshed.
* A scope can now be specified when creating a developer token.


0.26.4 (2024-10-28)
-------------------

* New: access-token endpoint now returns refresh token.


0.26.3 (2024-10-28)
-------------------

* User accounts are now automatically locked after 5 failed login attempts.
  (@YunhwanJeong).
* Stricter validation on the 'Create App Client Form.'
* Looks for database in 'public' searchPath in Postgres. (@Zen-cronic)
* Fix internal error on user/id route in Postgres. (@Zen-cronic)
* Generating arbitrary access-tokens is now behind the
  `a12n:access-token:generate` privilege instead of just `admin`. Having the
  `admin` privilege still includes this privilege so this is not a backwards
  compatibility break.
* Fix: Introspection on developer tokens threw an error.
* Fix: CSRF error on change password page (@Zen-cronic).


0.26.2 (2024-08-30)
-------------------

* Allow admins to auto-generate an intitial 'diceware' password when creating
  new users, which should make onboaring new users and testing easier.
* Fix CSRF error on register form
* Fix a bug in the automatic App creation flow


0.26.1 (2024-08-12)
-------------------

* Allow users to set up TOTP after registration.
* Add a new 'auth-factor' API endpoint, which lists all the authentication
  factors the user has setup. Currently it only supports 'password' and 'totp',
  but more will be added in the future.
* Fix test server.


0.26.0 (2024-07-31)
-------------------

New big release in a while! This release primarily adds support for multiple
email/addresses per user and separates the 'active' flag from the 'having
validated your email address' flag.  It also introduces experimental support
for a draft [OAuth2 flow for first-party apps][firstparty], which (right now)
only supports usernames and passwords, and is sure to change over time.. but
this will become the main framework for multi-step authentication with all
flavours of MFA. Please note that this release has a few database changes that
(depending on your database size) may take a bit to complete. MAKE A BACKUP! I
can't stress this enough!

* BC Break: Previous versions of a12nserver collated the 'active' status of
  users and whether or not their used email addresses were verified. These two
  flags are now separate. For a user to log in with their username and password
  their account must be active (now on by default) and email must be verified.
  When upgrading to 0.26 all active users will have their email automatically
  verified.
* BC Break: When creating users via the API, we no longer accept the 'active'
  flag. (is now on by default).
* New! Users can now be associated with multiple email addresses and/or phone
  numbers.
* Added support for [OAuth 2.0 Multiple Response Type Encoding
  Practices][firstparty]) aka the "authorization_challenge" flow.
* Upgraded to Curveball 1.
* Moved from CommonJS to ESM.
* Upgraded to Typescript 5.5.
* Dropped mocha for the built-in Node tester.
* #494: Add 'public' to Postgres schema search path. (@elaugier)
* Auto-generate API types from JSON schema.
* Internal: oauth2-client is renamed to app-client to reduce confusion a bit.
* Internal: `oauth2_codes` now remember what grant_type was used to generate
  the code, plus the `redirect_uri`.


0.25.4 (2024-02-26)
-------------------

* The 'scope' property on the OAuth2 introspection response was comma-separated
  when it should have been space-separated.


0.25.3 (2024-02-08)
-------------------

* Set Content-Type to application/json for `password` and `refresh_token`
  operations on the token endpoint.


0.25.2 (2023-12-01)
-------------------

* Fixed result of one-time-token if a custom expiry was used.


0.25.1 (2023-12-01)
-------------------

* Clients can now specify how long a one-time-token should be valid for.
* API clients can now request that one-time-tokens don't expire after use.
* The client_id is now validated to belong to the curent user when validating
  one-time-tokens.
* Fixed result of one-time-token if a custom expiry was used.


0.25.0 (2023-11-22)
-------------------

* Added two privileges for one-time-token use: `a12n:one-time-token:generate`
  and `a12n-one-time-token:exchange`, these both required the `admin`
  privilege. Theres no bc break here as the original `admin` privilege still
  covers these new ones.
* It wasn't possible to see a full principal even if a user had
  `a12n:principal:list` privilege.
* Added new privilege for changing passwords: `a12n:user:change-password`.
* Introspection endpoint now returns the `exp`, `sub`, `aud` and `iss`
  properties.
* Now returning a 422 for invalid passwords instead of 500.


0.24.0 (2023-11-09)
-------------------

* Upgrade to Redis 4.
* Improve user audit logging for various OAuth2 flows.
* Use SQLite3 WAL mode for better concurrency.


0.24.0-alpha.1 (2023-10-05)
---------------------------

* The Docker distribution now runs on Node 20 (upgraded from 16).
* Fixed a 500 error in the OAuth2 password flow.
* Updated to simplewebauthn 8.


0.24.0-alpha.0 (2023-10-04)
---------------------------

* Update to curveball 0.21
* Refactored the privilege system to make internally easier to use. There
  should be no end-user effects to this.
* Added a system group principal , which allows admins to set privileges for
  every user in the system.
* Fix Sqlite startup warning.
* The `/group/x/members` collection and associated operations and links have
  been removed. This endpoint had been marked deprecated in version 0.19 in May
  2021 and is now finally removed. If you still depended on this endpoint, all
  the related information can be found on the /group/x endpoint. This endpoint
  also has operations for modifying the members list.
* By default this server will no longer allow new users and apps to see the
  full list of other users, groups and apps. Any applications relying on this
  behavior need to give the relevant users the `a12n:principals:list`
  privilege. To get the old behavior, simply add this privilege to the new
  `$all` group.
* When a user goes from login to registration, the "continue" link will be
  remembered.
* The 'password' flow now also tracks apps that are granted access to user
  accounts
* When using the Redis session backend, CSRF tokens would not get stored
  correctly, causing some browser operations to fail.
* a12n-server will now report a better process name in linux process lists.
* The server now picks up the `CURVEBALL_ORIGIN` environment variable.


0.23.1 (2023-03-29)
-------------------

* Fix 500 error on /authorize endpoint when using Sqlite
* Fix CSRF error on create user form


0.23.0 (2022-01-12)
-------------------

* Update knex. Knex had a massive SQL injection vulnerability.
* 'scope' wasn't supported yet correctly in the `authorization_code` and
  `implicit` flows.
* Fixed some bugs in the 'active sessions' report, and add columns for
  `grant_type`, and `scope`.
* Common types, such `User`, `App`, `Group` types have been moved to
  `src/types.ts` for easier access.
* We're now keeping track of which scopes were granted to which apps per user.
* Support for RFC 9068: A standard format for JWT OAuth2 Access Tokens.
* Centralize CSRF token handling (for old browsers).
* Added a new 'add privilege' action, which is helpful for API clients.
* Fix bug: Incorrect url in `Location` header when creating a new user.
* #448: Fix 'create group' form.


0.22.0 (2022-09-27)
-------------------

Warning note for upgraders. This release has a database migration on the
`oauth2_tokens` table. For most users this is the largest table, some downtime
may be expected while the server runs its migrations.

* #425: Using a `client_secret` is now supported with `authorization_code`, and
  it's read from either the request body or HTTP Basic Authorization header.
* The service now keeps track when issuing access tokens, whether those tokens
  have used a `client_secret` or not, which `grant_type` was used to issue them
  and what scopes were requested. This work is done to better support OAuth2
  scopes in the future, and eventually OpenID Connect.
* Fixed broken 'principal uri' in introspection endpoint response.
* OAuth2 service is almost entirely rewritten.
* The number of tokens issued is now displayed on the home page.
* Large numbers are now abbreviated with `K` and `M`.
* #426: Updated to Curveball 0.20.
* #427: Typescript types for the database schema are now auto-generated with
  `mysql-types-generator`.


0.21.3 (2022-08-09)
-------------------

* It's now possible to generate a URI that completely takes a developer through
  the setup process for creating an OAuth2 client, with all values pre-filled.
  This makes it very easy for a developer to get their environment up and
  running without having to know all kinds of OAuth2 details (@AminDhouib).
* Fixed getting no feedback after changing group members. (@AminDhouib)
* Fixed the 'authenticated-as' link in the a12n-server home document; it had an
  extra slash.
* If you hit an authenticated page after login, you are now redirected back to
  that page after login.
* The `/register` endpoint can now take a `?continue=` uri parameter, making it
  possible to redirect back to any application after registering.


0.21.2 (2022-07-27)
-------------------

* Adding `schemas` and `.env.defaults` to the NPM package.


0.21.0 (2022-07-27)
-------------------

* New! Start a fresh a12nserver just by running `npx @curveball/a12n-server`
* #412: Fixed a few more PostgreSQL bugs (@AminDhouib)
* #407: Users can be added to groups again with their relative URI
  (@AminDhouib)
* #399: When trying to add a new OAuth2 client with an existing `client_id`,
  the server will now emit a 409 instead of a 500 error. (@AminDhouib)
* The `requirePkce` flag was not respected when creating a new OAuth2 client.


0.20.4 (2022-06-19)
-------------------

* #398: Allow the HTTP/1.1 KeepAlive timeout to be configured using the
  `KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable. (@pschwyter)
* #397: Add `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable to support password-protected
  redis servers. (@mihok)
* #400: Fix bug in the 'create app' form.
* #402: Add form for editing settings on OAuth2 clients.
* #401: Add schemas for user, app and group endpoints.


0.20.3 (2022-06-03)
-------------------

* Hide database settings from 'settings page'.


0.20.2 (2022-05-26)
-------------------

* Released with Alpha tag.
* Fix: Parsing HTTP Basic header containing a `:` in the password. This is
  heavily used in server-to-server oauth2 flows. (@pschwyter)
* Automatically open a debug connection on port 9339 when running with `make
  start-dev`. (@pschwyter)

🛳️ Ahoi from Halifax! 🛳️


0.20.1 (2022-05-17)
-------------------

* Released with Alpha tag.
* `MYSQL_PORT` and `MYSQL_HOST` were ignored. These settings now exist for
  backwards compatibility, but the backwards compatibility settings had a bug.

-------------------

* Released with Alpha tag.
* Now requires Node 16.
* Postgres support! (@mihok)
* Experimental sqlite support.

  discover JWT public keys.
* OAuth2 secrets are now prefixed with the `secret-token:` uri scheme, allowing
  github and other systems to detect possible commits of secret data.
* A new settings panel for admins, allowing admins to see exactly which
  settings have been applied. This is currently read-only.
* `.env.defaults` is no longer automatically loaded. The file still exists but
  its only purpose is to provide a template for developers to copy to `.env`.
* Updated 'create group' and 'create app' forms to be simpler.
* Show the public url when starting the server instead of just the TCP port.
* #382: Fix buggy email layout.


0.19.12 (2022-01-12)
--------------------

* This release reinstates the v0.19.10 changes after `@curveball/browser`
  received an updated logo.


0.19.11 (2022-01-07)
--------------------

* This release rolls back the 'app logo' feature. The default setting has
  cosmetic bugs.


0.19.10 (2022-01-07)
--------------------

* Add app logo to login, registration, lost-password pages.
* The 'Change password' form now lives on `/change-password` instead of
  `/changepassword` for consistency with other routes.
* Small fixes (Bad Gateway copyright notice, copy changes + new cancel button
  on reset password page).
* Update dependencies.


0.19.9 (2021-10-18)

* Add Curl to Docker image as it's a common health check tool.
* Fix a bug that preventing using `PATCH on /group/:id` in the HAL browser.


0.19.3 (2021-05-30)
-------------------

* Make sure that the `/health` endpoint also gets logged correctly.

-------------------

* Fix: bug in JSON schema for group members. Inconsistent property names.
* Renamed userHref to memberHref.


0.19.1 (2021-05-28)
-------------------

* Fix: bug in JSON schema for editing group members.
* @curveball/validator had a critical bug that caused error handling to break
  for validation errors.


0.19.0 (2021-05-27)
-------------------

* Redesigned home page.
* A drastically smaller Docker image. The uncompressed image size dropped from
  1.2G to 267M due to the use of multi-stage builds.
* Apps now appear in `/app` and no longer in `/user`.
* Groups now appear in `/group` and no longer in `/user`.
* HAL forms for adding and removing members to groups.
* Renamed 'users' to 'principals' in many places in the source, including
  database tables.
* Clean up line endings from `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` if they are not in the expected
  format. This will make it work better with at least AWS Secure Parameter
  Store / ECS / Lambda.
* First steps to integrating json-schema in a12nserver.


0.18.3 (2021-04-20)
-------------------

* `updatePassword` now supports creating a password without having an existing
  password.


0.18.2 (2021-04-15)
-------------------

* Activating users did not correctly check for "admin" privileges. This is now
  fixed.
* Added support for `PUT` on `/users/123`
* Allowing users to be activated using the `token-exchange` API.


0.18.1 (2021-04-05)
-------------------

* Url decode the 'href' on the `/user/byhref` endpoint.
* Make the 'privilege policy' textarea bigger.


0.18.0 (2021-04-05)
-------------------

* Added UIs for editing user information. (@mihok)
* Added preliminary support for JWT bearer tokens
  ([draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt-12][oauth2-jwt]).
* Added a new markdown-based home document, which will be a bit more user-
  friendly for non-devs.
* Added UI for setting privileges. (@mihok)
* All secret tokens are now URL-safe and generated non-blocking.
* Throw a 404 when trying to access the 'active sessions' page for a
  group-principal.


0.17.2 (2021-03-26)
-------------------

* Added a `/user/:id/password` endpoint. This allows an admin to easily change
  a user's password.


0.17.1 (2021-03-14)
-------------------

* Updated `simplewebauthn` dependencies to the latest version.
* Switched to 'indirect' attestation-type by default, allowing anomimized
  attestations to be used.
* It's now possible to set the value for the CORS `Allow-Origin` option. By
  default it's enabled, but if `cors.allowOrigin` is supplied, this can be
  overridden.


0.17.0 (2021-03-11)
-------------------

* Privileges assigned to groups are now inherited by all users who are part of
  that group, allowing the use of groups as 'roles'.
* Added a `/user/by-href/:href` endpoint, allowing API clients to look up users
  by their 'identity' like their email address.
* Added a `hasPassword` property to each user. This is only visible on 'your
  own' user or if you are an admin.
* The `/token-exchange` endpoint for one-time tokes now requires a `client_id`
  parameter, similar to OAuth2 endpoints.
* Fixed a number of internal APIs that let people generate passwords for non-
  user principals, or oauth2 credentails for groups. Everything is a bit
  stricter.
* Internally, 'users', 'apps' and 'groups' are now more often referred to by
  the name 'principal'. Before, these 3 categories of things were also referred
  to as 'user'. This migration is not complete, but it's a big first step.
  Eventually we'll have separate API roots for each of these.


0.16.0 (2021-03-07)
-------------------

* Added a `login.defaultRedirect` option. This setting allows an admin to
  specify where users should be redirected to after they log in.
* Added a 'one time token' API, allowing privileged clients to exchange tokens
  with regular OAuth2 access tokens. This is useful for custom implementations
  of 'lost password' features.
* Added an 'active sessions' API. This API lists all currently active
  access/refresh tokens for a user.
* Added an 'access token' endpoint, allowing you to generate a new access token
  if you had an already valid session.


0.15.5 (2021-02-23)
-------------------

* Another re-release to try and make Github npm packages function.


0.15.4 (2021-02-23)
-------------------

* This package is now published on npm under `@curveball/a12n-server`.


0.15.3 (2021-02-23)
-------------------

* Re-releasing to for Github auto-publishing npm packages.


0.15.2 (2021-02-23)
-------------------

* Added one-time-token API, allowing clients to get temporary login tokens for
  use with lost-password emails, invite emails.


0.15.1 (2021-02-18)
-------------------

* When updating the list group members, it's now possible to specify members by
  using absolute URIs.
* Updated to latest curveball APIs


0.15.0 (2021-02-02)
-------------------

* Added a 'first run' interface. If no users exist in the system at all,
  a12nserver will now drop you in a 'create admin user' interface, making the
  initial setup a LOT simpler.
* Updated the 'create oauth2 credentials' form to be more userfriendly.
* Fixed OAuth2 error responses.
* Added APIs for replacing the member list of a group (`PUT`).
* Added API for adding a member to a group (`POST`).
* Improved some of the installation instructions.
* Added a link from the users page back to the users list.


0.14.4 (2020-12-16)
-------------------

* Now supports Redis as a backend for session storage, which should make this
  server a lot better when load balanced on several machines.


0.14.3 (2020-12-16)
-------------------

* Updating dependencies


0.14.2 (2020-12-14)
-------------------

* #214: `continue` url was not being respected in the logout flow.


0.14.1 (2020-12-04)
-------------------

* Updated all dependencies, fixing a highlight.js security issue.
* Small tweaks to home document.


0.14.0 (2020-11-20)
