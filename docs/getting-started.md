Getting started
===============

To set up a new a12n-server from scratch, start by obtaining the following
prerequisites:

1. NodeJS (version 14 or higher) and `npm`.
2. `git`.
3. MySQL (For Mac: install via ).
    - For Mac: easy install Homebrew [MySQL package](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/mysql)
      via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
    - For Linux: `apt install mysql-server`
4. Optional: A working [Docker][1] installation. The server can also be run
   straight from the cli.

After all of these prerequisites are acquired, run:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:evert/a12n-server.git
cd a12n-server
npm install
```

If using Docker, finish off with:

```sh
make docker-build
```

MySQL setup
-----------

After you have MySQL up and running, create new empty database (/schema) & user for `a12n-server`. Replace 'your_password' with a proper user password of your creation.

```sh
mysql> CREATE DATABASE a12nserver;
mysql> CREATE USER 'a12nserver' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON a12nserver.* TO 'a12nserver';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

The next step is to insert the MySQL schemas that are shipping with the git repository. In the a12n-server project's root, just run:

```sh
cat mysql-schema/*.sql | mysql -u a12nserver -p -h hostname a12nserver
```

Running the server
------------------

Docker:

```sh
export MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
export MYSQL_USER=a12nserver
export MYSQL_DATABASE=a12nserver
docker run -it --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8531:8531 --name a12n-server-01 a12n-server
```

If you are running a12nserver outside of docker, the easiest way to change environment variables is to create a `.env` file in the a12n-server project root, and specify the following settings.

```sh
PORT=8531
MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_password
MYSQL_USER=a12nserver
MYSQL_DATABASE=a12nserver
PUBLIC_URI="http://localhost:8531/"
```

Note: There are several environment variables available to modify the a12n-server
behavior. See the table below.

|                           Name | Required? |               Default | Description                                                   |

| SMTP_URL                       |           |                       | See below section, [Email](#Email)                      |

| JWT_PRIVATE_KEY                | No        |                       | When set, a12nserver will generate JWT OAuth2 Access tokens as specified in [draft-ietf-oauth-access-token-jwt][oauth2-jwt]. If this is not set, opaque strings will be used |

To start the server, we use `make`. Simply execute

```sh
make start
```

Creating the first user
-----------------------

After installation, you can open the server via `https://localhost:8531/`,
which will prompt you to create your first admin user.

Email
-----

To use any email related feature, such as 'reset password', the following environment variables are also required.

```sh
export SMTP_URL="smtps://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/"
export SMTP_EMAIL_FROM='"[Name]" <[Username]@example.org>'
```
The SMTP_URL takes any format that that [Nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com/smtp/) takes.
