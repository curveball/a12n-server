Changelog
=========

0.26.0 (????-??-??)
-------------------

* BC Break: Previous versions of a12nserver collated the 'active' status of
  users and whether or not their used email addresses were verified. These two
  flags are now separate. For a user to log in with their username and password
  their account must be active (now on by default) and email must be verified.
  When upgrading to 0.26 all active users will have their email automatically
  verified.
* BC Break: When creating users via the API, we no longer accept the 'active'
  flag. (is now on by default).
* New! Users can now be associated with multiple email addresses and/or phone
  numbers.
* Upgraded to Curveball 1.
* Moved from CommonJS to ESM.
* Upgraded to Typescript 5.5.
* Dropped mocha for the built-in Node tester.
* #494: Add 'public' to Postgres schema search path. (@elaugier)
* Auto-generate API types from JSON schema.
* Internal: oauth2-client is renamed to app-client to reduce confusion a bit.


0.25.4 (2024-02-26)
-------------------

* The 'scope' property on the OAuth2 introspection response was comma-separated
  when it should have been space-separated.


0.25.3 (2024-02-08)
-------------------

* Set Content-Type to application/json for `password` and `refresh_token`
  operations on the token endpoint.


0.25.2 (2023-12-01)
-------------------

* Fixed result of one-time-token if a custom expiry was used.


0.25.1 (2023-12-01)
-------------------

* Clients can now specify how long a one-time-token should be valid for.
* API clients can now request that one-time-tokens don't expire after use.
* The client_id is now validated to belong to the curent user when validating
  one-time-tokens.


0.25.0 (2023-11-22)
-------------------

* Added two privileges for one-time-token use: `a12n:one-time-token:generate`
  and `a12n-one-time-token:exchange`, these both required the `admin`
  privilege. Theres no bc break here as the original `admin` privilege still
  covers these new ones.
* It wasn't possible to see a full principal even if a user had
  `a12n:principal:list` privilege.
* Added new privilege for changing passwords: `a12n:user:change-password`.
* Introspection endpoint now returns the `exp`, `sub`, `aud` and `iss`
  properties.
* Now returning a 422 for invalid passwords instead of 500.


0.24.0 (2023-11-09)
-------------------

* Upgrade to Redis 4.
* Improve user audit logging for various OAuth2 flows.
* Use SQLite3 WAL mode for better concurrency.


0.24.0-alpha.1 (2023-10-05)
---------------------------

* The Docker distribution now runs on Node 20 (upgraded from 16).
* Fixed a 500 error in the OAuth2 password flow.
* Updated to simplewebauthn 8.


0.24.0-alpha.0 (2023-10-04)
---------------------------

* Update to curveball 0.21
* Refactored the privilege system to make internally easier to use. There
  should be no end-user effects to this.
* Added a system group principal , which allows admins to set privileges for
  every user in the system.
* Fix Sqlite startup warning.
* The `/group/x/members` collection and associated operations and links have
  been removed. This endpoint had been marked deprecated in version 0.19 in May
  2021 and is now finally removed. If you still depended on this endpoint, all
  the related information can be found on the /group/x endpoint. This endpoint
  also has operations for modifying the members list.
* By default this server will no longer allow new users and apps to see the
  full list of other users, groups and apps. Any applications relying on this
  behavior need to give the relevant users the `a12n:principals:list`
  privilege. To get the old behavior, simply add this privilege to the new
  `$all` group.
* When a user goes from login to registration, the "continue" link will be
  remembered.
* The 'password' flow now also tracks apps that are granted access to user
  accounts
* When using the Redis session backend, CSRF tokens would not get stored
  correctly, causing some browser operations to fail.
* a12n-server will now report a better process name in linux process lists.
* The server now picks up the `CURVEBALL_ORIGIN` environment variable.


0.23.1 (2023-03-29)
-------------------

* Fix 500 error on /authorize endpoint when using Sqlite
* Fix CSRF error on create user form


0.23.0 (2022-01-12)
-------------------

* Update knex. Knex had a massive SQL injection vulnerability.
* 'scope' wasn't supported yet correctly in the `authorization_code` and
  `implicit` flows.
* Fixed some bugs in the 'active sessions' report, and add columns for
  `grant_type`, and `scope`.
* Common types, such `User`, `App`, `Group` types have been moved to
  `src/types.ts` for easier access.
* We're now keeping track of which scopes were granted to which apps per user.
* Support for RFC 9068: A standard format for JWT OAuth2 Access Tokens.
* Centralize CSRF token handling (for old browsers).
* Added a new 'add privilege' action, which is helpful for API clients.
* Fix bug: Incorrect url in `Location` header when creating a new user.
* #448: Fix 'create group' form.


0.22.0 (2022-09-27)
-------------------

Warning note for upgraders. This release has a database migration on the
`oauth2_tokens` table. For most users this is the largest table, some downtime
may be expected while the server runs its migrations.

* #425: Using a `client_secret` is now supported with `authorization_code`, and
  it's read from either the request body or HTTP Basic Authorization header.
* The service now keeps track when issuing access tokens, whether those tokens
  have used a `client_secret` or not, which `grant_type` was used to issue them
  and what scopes were requested. This work is done to better support OAuth2
  scopes in the future, and eventually OpenID Connect.
* Fixed broken 'principal uri' in introspection endpoint response.
* OAuth2 service is almost entirely rewritten.
* The number of tokens issued is now displayed on the home page.
* Large numbers are now abbreviated with `K` and `M`.
* #426: Updated to Curveball 0.20.
* #427: Typescript types for the database schema are now auto-generated with
  `mysql-types-generator`.


0.21.3 (2022-08-09)
-------------------

* It's now possible to generate a URI that completely takes a developer through
  the setup process for creating an OAuth2 client, with all values pre-filled.
  This makes it very easy for a developer to get their environment up and
  running without having to know all kinds of OAuth2 details (@AminDhouib).
* Fixed getting no feedback after changing group members. (@AminDhouib)
* Fixed the 'authenticated-as' link in the a12n-server home document; it had an
  extra slash.
* If you hit an authenticated page after login, you are now redirected back to
  that page after login.
* The `/register` endpoint can now take a `?continue=` uri parameter, making it
  possible to redirect back to any application after registering.


0.21.2 (2022-07-27)
-------------------

* Adding `schemas` and `.env.defaults` to the NPM package.


0.21.0 (2022-07-27)
-------------------

* New! Start a fresh a12nserver just by running `npx @curveball/a12n-server`
* #412: Fixed a few more PostgreSQL bugs (@AminDhouib)
* #407: Users can be added to groups again with their relative URI
  (@AminDhouib)
* #399: When trying to add a new OAuth2 client with an existing `client_id`,
  the server will now emit a 409 instead of a 500 error. (@AminDhouib)
* The `requirePkce` flag was not respected when creating a new OAuth2 client.


0.20.4 (2022-06-19)
-------------------

* #398: Allow the HTTP/1.1 KeepAlive timeout to be configured using the
  `KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT_MS` environment variable. (@pschwyter)
* #397: Add `REDIS_PASSWORD` environment variable to support password-protected
  redis servers. (@mihok)
* #400: Fix bug in the 'create app' form.
* #402: Add form for editing settings on OAuth2 clients.
* #401: Add schemas for user, app and group endpoints.


0.20.3 (2022-06-03)
-------------------

* Hide database settings from 'settings page'.


0.20.2 (2022-05-26)
-------------------

* Released with Alpha tag.
* Fix: Parsing HTTP Basic header containing a `:` in the password. This is
  heavily used in server-to-server oauth2 flows. (@pschwyter)
* Automatically open a debug connection on port 9339 when running with `make
  start-dev`. (@pschwyter)

üõ≥Ô∏è Ahoi from Halifax! üõ≥Ô∏è


0.20.1 (2022-05-17)
-------------------

* Released with Alpha tag.

* Redesigned home page.
* A drastically smaller Docker image. The uncompressed image size dropped from
  1.2G to 267M due to the use of multi-stage builds.
* Apps now appear in `/app` and no longer in `/user`.
* Groups now appear in `/group` and no longer in `/user`.
* HAL forms for adding and removing members to groups.
* Renamed 'users' to 'principals' in many places in the source, including
  database tables.
* Clean up line endings from `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` if they are not in the expected

* First steps to integrating json-schema in a12nserver.


0.18.3 (2021-04-20)
-------------------

* `updatePassword` now supports creating a password without having an existing
  password.


0.18.2 (2021-04-15)

0.17.2 (2021-03-26)
-------------------

* Added a `/user/:id/password` endpoint. This allows an admin to easily change
  a user's password.


0.17.1 (2021-03-14)
-------------------

* Updated `simplewebauthn` dependencies to the latest version.
* Switched to 'indirect' attestation-type by default, allowing anomimized
  attestations to be used.

  default it's enabled, but if `cors.allowOrigin` is supplied, this can be
  overridden.


0.17.0 (2021-03-11)
-------------------

* Privileges assigned to groups are now inherited by all users who are part of
  that group, allowing the use of groups as 'roles'.
* Added a `/user/by-href/:href` endpoint, allowing API clients to look up users
  by their 'identity' like their email address.
* Added a `hasPassword` property to each user. This is only visible on 'your
  own' user or if you are an admin.
* The `/token-exchange` endpoint for one-time tokes now requires a `client_id`
  parameter, similar to OAuth2 endpoints.
* Fixed a number of internal APIs that let people generate passwords for non-
  user principals, or oauth2 credentails for groups. Everything is a bit
  stricter.
* Internally, 'users', 'apps' and 'groups' are now more often referred to by
  the name 'principal'. Before, these 3 categories of things were also referred
  to as 'user'. This migration is not complete, but it's a big first step.
  Eventually we'll have separate API roots for each of these.


0.16.0 (2021-03-07)
-------------------

* Added a `login.defaultRedirect` option. This setting allows an admin to
  specify where users should be redirected to after they log in.
* Added a 'one time token' API, allowing privileged clients to exchange tokens
  with regular OAuth2 access tokens. This is useful for custom implementations
  of 'lost password' features.

  initiated by the current browser session.
* The 'logout' endpoint now has support for a `continue` query parameter, to
  let the user get redirected back to a new endpoint after logout.
* Now using an 'ip to country' database to figure out where users are logging
  in from, to aid with intrusion detection features if these ever land.
* A new system that will warn the user and prevent starting if some of the
  database patches have not been applied.

0.12.0 (2020-01-22)
-------------------

* Added a `/privileges` endpoint to easily find out what kind of privileges are
  used in the system.
* The server now has an `admin` privilege, which is required to create new
  users or find information about other users.
* Users that are not yet marked `active` now show up in the `/users`
